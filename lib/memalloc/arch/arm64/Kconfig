	  The kernel memory allocator divides physically contiguous memory
	  blocks into "zones", where each zone is a power of two number of
	  pages.  This option selects the largest power of two that the kernel
	  keeps in the memory allocator.  If you need to allocate very large
	  blocks of physically contiguous memory, then you may need to
	  increase this value.

	  This config option is actually maximum order plus one. For example,
	  a value of 11 means that the largest free memory block is 2^10 pages.

	  We make sure that we can allocate upto a HugePage size for each configuration.
	  Hence we have :
		MAX_ORDER = (PMD_SHIFT - PAGE_SHIFT) + 1 => PAGE_SHIFT - 2

	  However for 4K, we choose a higher default value, 11 as opposed to 10, giving us
	  4M allocations matching the default size used by generic code.
