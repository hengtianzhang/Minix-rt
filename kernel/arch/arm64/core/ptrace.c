 * SPSR_ELx bits which are always architecturally RES0 per ARM DDI 0487D.a.
 * We permit userspace to set SSBS (AArch64 bit 12, AArch32 bit 23) which is
 * not described in ARM DDI 0487D.a.
 * We treat PAN and UAO as RES0 bits, as they are meaningless at EL0, and may
 * be allocated an EL0 meaning in future.
 * Userspace cannot use these until they have an architectural meaning.
 * Note that this follows the SPSR_ELx format, not the AArch32 PSR format.
 * We also reserve IL for the kernel; SS is handled dynamically.
